# TryHackMe-Journey
A record of my hands-on cybersecurity learning through TryHackMe labs, tools, and challenges.

# July 10th - The start of it all.
- I hacked my first website today (a fake bank account website).
- Reflection: It was pretty cool lol.
- I always did feel saucy using the terminal. Now it has been put to good use.

- Tools used: GoBuster, Terminal/Command Line.
