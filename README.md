# TryHackMe-Journey
A record of my hands-on cybersecurity learning through TryHackMe labs, tools, and challenges.

# July 10th - The start of it all. Hacking First Website.
- I hacked my first website today (a fake bank account website).
- Reflection: It was pretty cool lol. I always did feel saucy using the terminal. Now, it has been put to good use.

- Tools used: GoBuster, Terminal/Command Line.

# Detected Malicious IP Address & Blocked It.

# 7/17 - Spoofing a MAC Address to Access Paid Internet. IP and Mac Addresses.

Networks:

  -> IP Address, Internet Protocol, 4 Octects.
  -> MAC Address, Media Access Control, 12 character hexadecimal.
- Public and Private networks.
